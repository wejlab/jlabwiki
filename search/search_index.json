Their primary goals are to ensure that all code related to a manuscript is: Publicly accessible Reproducible Well-documented Well-organized This includes code for data access, preprocessing, analysis, and table/figure generation . When to Initiate a Review A manuscript code review should take place before submitting the final draft to a journal or preprint server. At least two pod members must complete the review, which could be discussed in a scheduled pod meeting. Give reviewers at least 1 week to complete their review Provide each reviewer with: A link to the GitHub repository A draft of the manuscript Manuscript GitHub Repository All analysis-related materials must be included in a single GitHub repository. Data may be hosted externally, but the repository must contain clear instructions or code to retrieve that data . Tip: Well-documented, modular code written throughout the project will reduce the workload during manuscript prep. Recommended Repository Structure R Markdown file Follows the manuscript's logic and structure: Raw data retrieval Data cleaning and preprocessing Data analysis Figure/table creation sessionInfo() block Clear narrative text throughout PDF of the R Markdown A static, reproducible version of the work R/ folder Custom functions split into separate .R files All functions documented using roxygen2 Include usage examples for key user-facing functions README.md Overview of repository structure Instructions for running the analysis (i.e., point to the specific .md file) Direct user to key functions DESCRIPTION file Follows R package standards Must include: name, title, authors, R version, and required packages Reviewer Responsibilities Reviewers should clone the repository and assess the following: Reproducibility Can the R Markdown be run start-to-finish on your machine? Output should match the included PDF. All required data should be accessible (no local paths or hardcoded directories). If errors occur, confirm whether they stem from environment/version differences. Resolve these issues before moving to steps 2 and 3. Code Quality R Markdown is clear and matches the manuscript's structure. Code is well-commented. Functions in the R/ folder have clear roxygen2 documentation. General Feedback Provide suggestions for improvement. Reference the General Guidelines for Reviewers for additional points. Giving Feedback Use GitHub Issues for detailed comments A brief written summary is also encouraged\u2014include both praise and suggestions Reviewers should be able to: Reproduce the analysis independently Understand how to use any included functions If clarification is needed, the author must update the code (e.g., improve README, improve object names, or expand function descriptions).","title":"Manuscript Submission Code Review"},{"location":"code_review/manuscript_code_review/#manuscript-submission-code-review","text":"Manuscript submission code reviews are the most in-depth reviews conducted in the lab.

Request Reviews Early The earlier you ask for feedback, the less likely you'll need to make major revisions later. 2. Follow a Style Guide Adhering to language-specific style guides improves readability and consistency. For R (tidyverse style): R tidyverse style guide styler package : Automatically reformats code to match tidyverse standards. 3. Write Clear, Maintainable Code General Guidelines Use descriptive variable names (avoid temp , final , var1 , etc.). Keep lines under 80 characters wide for readability. Functions should be <50 lines long to encourage modular, reusable code. For Packages Use small, focused functions with clear roxygen2 headers. Inline comments should not be needed\u2014function docs should be self-explanatory. For Analyses Use R Markdown files: Include informative narrative text for each code block. Minimize inline comments by using well-documented functions. Store reusable functions in an R/ directory and document with roxygen2 . For Scripts Use R Markdown when possible. Comment generously throughout standalone scripts. 4. Use GitHub Effectively All project code should be hosted on GitHub. Best practices include: For Analyses, Projects, or Papers Organize your repository with: An R Markdown file for the analysis A knit PDF version Custom functions in an R/ folder A README.md with usage instructions A DESCRIPTION file For Packages Follow Hadley Wickham\u2019s package guide Follow Bioconductor standards GitHub Tips Ensure repositories contain everything needed to reproduce your results Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking, feature requests, and reviewer feedback Commit and push regularly (after verifying that your code works) Keeping your working version on GitHub helps prevent accidental loss and supports collaborative development 5. Write Tests Automated testing ensures that your code behaves as expected and is suitable for others to use. When to Use Tests Required for code that will be reused or shared (e.g., packages). Optional but recommended for one-off analyses or exploratory code. Testing Best Practices Run standard checks: R CMD check BiocCheck (for Bioconductor submissions) Build in input validation with user-friendly error messages: Use if statements to catch invalid inputs early. Make error messages clear and actionable. Test edge cases and expected behavior : Use testthat for automated tests.","title":"Tips and Resources for Developers"},{"location":"code_review/tips_code_review/#tips-and-resources-for-developers","text":"These best practices will help you write clear, reproducible, and well-documented code, making code reviews and collaborations smoother.","title":"Tips and Resources for Developers"},{"location":"code_review/tips_code_review/#1-request-reviews-early","text":"The earlier you ask for feedback, the less likely you'll need to make major revisions later.","title":"1.
