To join, log onto Evan\u2019s Zoom meeting (See Slack for link). Instructions for presenters Lab meetings are assigned according to a rotation schedule of lab members ordered by topic. All lab members are assigned a topic that best reflects their research. Ice breakers can be anything that gets people having fun or getting to know each other better. They can take up to 15-20 minutes. Be creative! Presenters can speak on any topic they choose, although the rotation schedule is based on their primary research topic. Presenters should shoot for ~30 minutes. There will be separate time allotted for questions and discussion. Note: If you don\u2019t have any research updates, please present a paper in your field that is of interest to you and/or others in the lab!","title":"Lab Meeting"},{"location":"lab_meeting/#lab-meeting","text":"Lab meeting is held on Thursdays from 10-11:30 AM Eastern.
