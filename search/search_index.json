To join, log onto Evan\u2019s Zoom meeting (See Slack for link). Instructions for presenters Lab meetings are assigned according to a rotation schedule of lab members ordered by topic. All lab members are assigned a topic that best reflects their research. Ice breakers can be anything that gets people having fun or getting to know each other better. They can take up to 15-20 minutes. Be creative! Presenters can speak on any topic they choose, although the rotation schedule is based on their primary research topic. Presenters should shoot for ~30 minutes. There will be separate time allotted for questions and discussion. Note: If you don\u2019t have any research updates, please present a paper in your field that is of interest to you and/or others in the lab!","title":"Lab Meeting"},{"location":"lab_meeting/lab_meeting/#johnson-lab-meeting","text":"Lab meeting is held on Thursdays from 10-11:30 AM Eastern.

I\u2019m currently a postdoc in the Kolachalama lab. I have a MS in statistics and a PhD in bioinformatics. I am interested in the intersection of cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders, which intersects with the focus of my T32 postdoctoral fellowship in cardiovascular epidemiology. I aspire to join academia and am working towards submitting a career development K award this fall. I'm an expert in microbiome analysis and profiling methods. I've also performed gene expression analyses and worked with single-cell RNA-seq data. What I\u2019m up to currently: Working on a variety of projects with Kolachalama lab and the Johnson lab (my PhD lab which now resides at Rutgers University). Writing grants.
